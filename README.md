# Go-Playground

This repository is for code snippets with example on how to use different basic go-lang syntax.

## TODOs:
- Include example on **anonymous struct** similar to what is shown [here](https://blog.boot.dev/golang/anonymous-structs-golang/) once any HTTP request is included on the project for unmarshaling JSON to the basics project folder.
